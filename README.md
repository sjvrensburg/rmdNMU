R Markdown templates for Nelson Mandela University's Statistics Department.
Templates are broadly based on colours and fonts specified in Nelson Mandela
University's [Digital Brand Guide](https://staff.mandela.ac.za/staff/media/Store/documents/InstID/Manual/Nelson-Mandela-University-Digital-Brand-Guide.pdf).

Currently implements a document template for R practicals. More templates are planned.

## Installation

You can install the development version of rmdNMU from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# Uncomment the next line if you do not have `remotes` installed.
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("sjvrensburg/rmdNMU")
```

To render to PDF, you require a working LaTeX installation. We suggest `tinytex`. [Please see the `tinytex` documentation.](https://yihui.org/tinytex/)
