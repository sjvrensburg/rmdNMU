# Instructions

Please answer all questions clearly and show your working.

## Question 1 [10 marks]

Solve the following equation:

$$x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0$$

```{r, echo=params$solutions, eval=params$solutions}
# Solution code (only shown when solutions = TRUE)
# Using quadratic formula: x = (-b ± √(b²-4ac)) / 2a
a <- 1; b <- 5; c <- 6
discriminant <- b^2 - 4*a*c
x1 <- (-b + sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)
x2 <- (-b - sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)
cat("Solutions: x =", x1, "or x =", x2)
```

$if(params.solutions)$
**Solution**: The solutions are x = -2 and x = -3.
$endif$

## Question 2 [15 marks]

Explain the concept of statistical significance.

$if(params.solutions)$
**Solution**: Statistical significance refers to the likelihood that a result occurred by chance. A result is typically considered statistically significant if the p-value is less than 0.05, meaning there's less than a 5% probability the result occurred by random chance alone.
$endif$
