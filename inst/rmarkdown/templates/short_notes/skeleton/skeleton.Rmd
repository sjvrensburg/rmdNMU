# Introduction

This document tests all the custom features of the **Short Notes** template.

## Cross-referencing

We define a special vector below:

::: {.definition #vec-zeros-ones name="Vectors of Zeros and Ones"}
A vector of zeros, denoted \(\mathbf{0}\), is a vector where all components are zero.
Similarly, a vector of ones, denoted \(\mathbf{1}\), is a vector where all components are one.
:::

As we saw in \@ref(def:vec-zeros-ones), these special vectors have important properties.

## Theorems and Proofs

::: {.theorem #vector-addition name="Vector Addition"}
Let \(\mathbf{0}\) be the zero vector. Then, for any vector \(\mathbf{v}\):

\[
\mathbf{0} + \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{v}.
\]
:::

::: {.proof}
By the definition of \(\mathbf{0}\), adding it to any vector does not change the vector:
\[
\mathbf{0} + \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{v}.
\]
:::



As shown in \@ref(thm:vector-addition), the zero vector behaves as expected.

## Example Applications

::: {.example #vector-example name="Vector Computation Example"}
Consider the vector \(\mathbf{v} = (3,4)\). Then,
\[
\mathbf{0} + \mathbf{v} = (3,4).
\]
:::

## Important Notes and Warnings

::: {.importantbox name="Key Concept"}
Understanding the role of the zero vector is fundamental in linear algebra.
:::

::: {.warningbox name="Common Mistakes"}
Be careful to distinguish between scalar zero \(0\) and the zero vector \(\mathbf{0}\).
:::

## Code Examples

We can compute with vectors in R:

```{r vector-addition, echo=TRUE}
v <- c(3, 4)
z <- c(0, 0)
v + z  # Should return (3,4)
```

Inline calculation: The result of \(2+2\) is `r 2+2`.

## Conclusion

This document successfully tests:

- Theorem-like environments
- Cross-referencing
- Custom boxes (warnings, examples, important notes)
- Code execution
- Mathematical notation
