\question[1]
What is this?
\begin{solution}[2.2cm]
That is a question and this is the solution.
\end{solution}

\question
Suppose that we want to split a question into multiple parts.

\begin{parts}
\part[1]
Is this possible?
\begin{solution}[1cm]
Yes! By the way, you can include tick marks.\halftick \tick \doubletick

These also work in maths environments:
\[
\sqrt{x+y} \ne \sqrt{x} + \sqrt{y} \tick
\]


\end{solution}

\part[1]
Where do the solutions go?
\begin{solution}[1cm]
You just place the solution environment below the part.
\end{solution}

\end{parts}

\question[10]
Does code work in solution environments?

\begin{solutioncode}
Kinda... Use the custom `solutioncode` environment:
```{r}
A <- matrix(rnorm(10), ncol = 2)
A
```
It's not pretty, but it works.
\end{solutioncode}

\question
Not really a question, more of a comment. Code works in questions:
```{r}
A <- matrix(rnorm(10), ncol = 2)
A
```

\begin{solution}
\emoji{partying-face} And, yes, emojis also work.
\end{solution}
