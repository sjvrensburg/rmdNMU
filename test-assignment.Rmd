# Test Assignment

## Question 1

This tests basic functionality:

- List item 1
- List item 2
- List item 3

Write some code:

```r
# Test code block
x <- 1:10
mean(x)
```

## Question 2

Test verbatim and special characters:

The `\VerbBar` command should work: |test|

Some math: $x = \frac{a}{b}$

## Question 3

Test that no "already defined" errors occur with:

- `\tightlist` in lists
- `\VerbBar` in verbatim
- Standard LaTeX commands
