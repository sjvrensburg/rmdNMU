# Introduction

## Test Slide with Lists

This slide tests the `\tightlist` command:

- First item
- Second item
  - Nested item
  - Another nested item
- Third item

## Test Slide with Code

```r
# Test code block
x <- 1:10
y <- x^2
plot(x, y)
```

## Test Slide with Math

Some mathematical notation:

$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = \bar{x} \cdot n$$

The `\VerbBar` command should work: |test|

# Conclusion

## Summary

- All commands should work without errors
- No "already defined" warnings
- Proper rendering of all elements
