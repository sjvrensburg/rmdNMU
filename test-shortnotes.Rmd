# Introduction

This document tests the short notes template with theorem environments.

## Test Lists

Testing the `\tightlist` command:

- First item
- Second item
  - Nested item
  - Another nested item
- Third item

## Test Theorem Environments

::: {.definition}
**Test Definition**: This is a test definition to ensure the `definition` environment works without conflicts.
:::

::: {.theorem}
**Test Theorem**: This is a test theorem to ensure the `theorem` environment works.
:::

::: {.example}
**Test Example**: This is a test example.
:::

## Test Code Blocks

```r
# Test code with VerbBar
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
y <- x | length(x)  # This uses the | operator
```

## Test Verbatim

The `\VerbBar` command: |test|

Some inline code: `x <- 1:10`

# Conclusion

All theorem environments and commands should work without "already defined" errors.
